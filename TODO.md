TO DO list for treemap project
------------------------------

Short term
----------

  * Add Tree planting date, and Country/Province/County of collection,
    passing location data to maps.google.com. Ask Kyle about a data
    dump of these items.
  * Ask Eliz Wheeler to send wood images so we can serve a single wool
    image pic.
  * Start building a characters matrix for the AA taxa (at genus
    level). Then we could do a search to return the locations of trees
    with a certain character. Concentrate on winter characters
    (phyllotaxy, budscales...)
  * Full char list: phyllotaxy, floral morph (5-10 chars), short
    shoots, venation, stipules, pinnate/lobed/needles, mono/sympodial,
    decd/evergreen, floweringtime, habit

  * Phylogenetic tree information.  Search for a taxon for the
    nearest, 2nd nearest, third nearest family, and then click on the
    new family names to plot those on mapLo
	

Long term
---------

  * Taxon-dependent (e.g., _Acer_ dioecy) observations
  * Add link to Picup iPhone app, so that iPhones can upload images
  * Look into failure of Blackberries to use image maps
  * Collector names
  * Integrate treemob

Solved
------

  * Work out why the division marker sent by iCab iPhone browser is not
    being recognized : iCab cannot sent multipart data other than a
    single image
